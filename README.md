# Autonomous-Rover
This is a LEGO Technic Autonomous Rover. This vehicle utilises my knowledge and understanding gained from the Udacity AI and Robotics courses and the Coursera Robotics Specialization (in progress). The chassis is made out of LEGO Technic pieces. The main onboard computing will be done with a Raspberry Pi 3 with associated IMU and Pi Camera. These sensors and hardware are intended to facilitate robot perception, robotic search/motion planning and obstacle avoidance. This toy-scale autonomous rover would represent AI used in a robotic car.

Hardware
- Raspberry Pi 3
- IMU
- Pi Camera
- H-bridge Motor Controller
- DC motors

Aims
- Computer vision to detect obstacles/path
- Implement robot motion planning
- Carry out Python and OpenCV image processing on the Raspberry Pi
- Create custom laser-cut/3D-printed parts to connect the hardware to LEGO
