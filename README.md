# Autonomous-Rover
This is a LEGO Technic Autonomous Rover. This vehicle utilises my knowledge and understanding gained from the Udacity AI and Robotics courses and the Coursera Robotics Specialization. The chassis is made out of LEGO Technic pieces. The main onboard computing will be done with a Raspberry Pi 3 with associated IMU and Pi Camera. These sensors and hardware is intended to determine robot perception, robotic planning and obstacle avoidance.
